# BasicDrumKit
Play a basic drum using mouse or keyboard

Since i stream my Playstation 5 games i wanted to have a set of quick sound library to be able to play when i need them. There are hardwares that you can connect to your pc and it would trigger a sound based on the key. Those hardwares cost minimally more than hundred dollars and since we are programmer, we do things our way. I created this simple drum kit to be able to play different sounds with the click of a mouse button or by quickly pressing the key on keyboard. This is a personal project and if you have any suggestion, please feel free to let me know and i can modify it. You can also feel free to clone the project and improve on it. I plan to have a music set for the future where you can play different instruments.
